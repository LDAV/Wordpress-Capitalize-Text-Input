# Wordpress-Capitalize-Text-Input
Aren't you tired of rewriting the titles of your posts pasted in uppercase?

This small but useful plugin, adds a small button in admin input form to convert title in Proper case, when you edit your post (or page).

We're working to add more different features, such as "all lowercase", or "UPPERCASE" or a "Capitalize All Words" option. Let us know your suggestions in Support Area.
